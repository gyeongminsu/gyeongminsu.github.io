Hi. I am Minsoo-Gyeong, B.S pursuing Student of Computer Science(5th semester) in University of Seoul.

I am currently focusing my attention on the development of Artificial Intelligence models, including natural language processing and multi-modal.

As part of that, I am currently working as an internship in [the Intelligent Big Data Lab of the Urban Big Data Convergence Department](https://intelligent-big-data-lab.notion.site/) since February 2024.

Also, since July 2023, I have been working as the 20th Vice Club President of [Tobigâ€™s, the AI & Big data Union Academic Club in Korea](https://tobigs-datamarket.github.io/).
